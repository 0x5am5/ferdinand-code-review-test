# File Asset System Tests

This directory contains comprehensive tests for the File Asset Management System (Phase 2).

## Test Files

### `file-assets.test.ts`
Full integration test suite using Jest. Covers:
- File upload (single and multi-file)
- File size validation
- Category and tag assignment during upload
- Asset listing with pagination
- Filtering by category, tag, and visibility
- Asset retrieval and download
- Asset metadata updates
- Soft deletion
- Category management (CRUD)
- Tag management (CRUD)
- Permission system validation

**To run (requires Jest setup):**
```bash
npm test tests/file-assets.test.ts
```

### `file-assets-manual.ts`
Manual test script that can be run without Jest. Tests the same functionality but with simpler assertions.

**To run:**
```bash
# Make sure server is running first
npm run dev

# In another terminal:
npx tsx tests/file-assets-manual.ts
```

**Configuration:**
- Update `TEST_CLIENT_ID` in the file to match your test client
- Ensure dev auth bypass is enabled OR provide valid session cookies

  - Guest: View shared assets only
  - Standard: CRUD own assets, view shared
  - Editor: CRUD own assets, edit shared
  - Admin: Full access
  - Super Admin: Full access

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites
1. PostgreSQL database running
2. Environment variables configured (see [Test Environment Setup](#test-environment-setup))
3. Server running on `http://localhost:3001`
4. Valid test client in database

### Test Environment Setup

Before running tests, you need to configure your test environment variables:

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.test.example .env.test
   ```

2. Edit `.env.test` and fill in your actual test values:
   - Database connection string for your test database
   - Test API keys and secrets (use test/development credentials, not production)
   - Firebase test project credentials
   - Other service-specific test credentials

3. **Important**: Never commit `.env.test` to version control. It contains sensitive test credentials.

The `.env.test.example` file in the repository root shows all required environment variables with example/dummy values.

### Quick Start
```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev

# In another terminal, run manual tests
npx tsx tests/file-assets-manual.ts
```

### Expected Output
```
🧪 Starting File Asset API Manual Tests

API Base: http://localhost:3001/api
Test Client ID: 1

✅ Upload file successfully
✅ List assets with pagination
✅ Get single asset by ID
✅ Download asset file
✅ Create asset category
✅ List asset categories
✅ Create asset tag
✅ List asset tags
✅ Update asset metadata
✅ Filter assets by visibility
✅ Soft delete asset
✅ Delete test category
✅ Delete test tag

📊 Test Summary:
Total: 13
Passed: 13
Failed: 0

✅ All tests passed!
```

## Test Data Cleanup

The manual test script automatically cleans up test data after running:
- Uploaded test files are soft-deleted
- Test categories are removed
- Test tags are removed

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Errors
If you get 401 errors:
- Ensure dev auth bypass is enabled in the server configuration
- OR provide valid session cookies in the test script

### Permission Errors (403)
Some tests require admin permissions:
- Category creation/update/delete
- Tag deletion
- These tests will be skipped with a warning if not admin

### File Upload Errors
If file uploads fail:
- Check the `uploads/` directory exists and is writable
- Verify storage configuration in `server/storage/config.ts`
- Check file size doesn't exceed 500MB limit

### Database Errors
If you get database errors:
- Ensure database migrations have been run: `npm run db:push`
- Verify test client exists in the database
- Check PostgreSQL connection

## Adding New Tests

To add new tests to the manual script:

```typescript
await runTest('Test name', async () => {
  const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE}/your-endpoint`);
  const data = await response.json();

  assertEqual(response.status, 200, 'Request failed');
  assert(data.someProperty, 'Property not found');
});
```

### `file-assets-comprehensive.test.ts`
Comprehensive test suite covering advanced scenarios:

**Role-Based Permissions:**
- ✅ Guest user permissions and restrictions
- ✅ Standard user CRUD operations
- ✅ Editor permissions (edit shared assets)
- ✅ Admin full access

**Search Functionality:**

**To run:**
```bash
npm test tests/file-assets-comprehensive.test.ts
```
