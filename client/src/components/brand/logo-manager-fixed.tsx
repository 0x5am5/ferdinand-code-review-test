  main: "This is the primary logo and should be used whenever possible. It's the most recognizable and complete version of the brand identity. When in doubt, default to this version.",
  horizontal: "This version is optimized for wide, shallow spaces. It's typically used where vertical room is limited and may be a simplified or type-focused variation of the main logo.",
  vertical: "The vertical logo is designed for narrow, tall spaces where the main logo doesn't fit well. It maintains brand recognition while adapting to limited width.",
  square: "The square logo is built for evenly proportioned placements like social media avatars, favicons, or app tiles. It's a compact, versatile version that keeps the brand visible in constrained layouts.",
  app_icon: "The app icon is tailored for mobile screens and app stores. It's designed to be bold, clean, and readable at small sizes while still representing the brand clearly.",
  favicon: "The favicon is the smallest logo format, used in browser tabs, bookmarks, and web toolbars. It distills the brand into a tiny but crisp graphic that holds up at low resolution."
