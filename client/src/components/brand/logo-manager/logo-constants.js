    square: "Use in spaces where simplicity matters: social icons, profile images, or internal dashboards. Stick to its native proportions and avoid visual clutter around it.",
    app_icon: "Use on mobile devices, app marketplaces, and launcher screens. Make sure it renders cleanly at small sizes, and avoid placing it on complex backgrounds.",
    favicon: "Use in browsers and tab displays. This should always be the most simplified version of your logo mark—no words, no extras. Stick to a .ico or .svg file where supported for best results.",
