Prompt for AI Developers: Next Steps for
Figma Integration
1. Overview
This document outlines the next phase of development for the Figma integration within
Ferdinand. We have a solid foundation in place, and the focus for this iteration is to
implement the core Figma REST API integration and develop the Figma Plugin to enable
two-way synchronization of design system elements.
2. Current Implementation Status
We have successfully implemented the following foundational elements:
Feature Toggle System: A figma_integration feature toggle is in place,
controlling the visibility of design system features in both the dashboard and client
management pages.
Design System Tab Framework: A
Design System" tab appears in the client sidebar when Figma integration is enabled,
currently showing placeholder UI. * Existing Infrastructure Ready for Integration: *
Design System API ( /api/design-system ) for theme.json and raw token
management. * Fully implemented Color System with palette management. * Complete
Typography System with font management and type scales. * Logo System with Figma
link support in logo metadata. * File Conversion System handling SVG, AI, EPS, PDF
formats. * Figma-Ready Components: * Logo manager supports Figma links in
"Editable Design Files" section. * Design system builder can export CSS/SCSS tokens. *
Raw design tokens system for spacing, colors, typography, etc.
3. Next Steps: Core Figma Integration Features (Not Yet
Implemented)
The primary objective for this phase is to implement the following core Figma
integration features:
•
• 
3.1. Figma REST API Integration
Objective: Establish robust communication between Ferdinand's backend and the
Figma REST API.
Key Tasks:
Authentication: Implement secure authentication with Figma (e.g., OAuth,
Personal Access Tokens – prioritize user-friendly options).
Data Retrieval: Develop functionality to read and extract design data (colors,
typography, spacing, component properties, interactive states) from specified
Figma files.
Data Sync (Figma to Ferdinand): Implement logic to pull design tokens and
styles from Figma into Ferdinand's design system. This should update the
existing theme.json and raw tokens.
Data Sync (Ferdinand to Figma): Implement logic to push design tokens and
styles from Ferdinand to a connected Figma library. This will involve updating
existing styles/components in Figma or creating new ones if they don't exist.
Library Analytics (Future Consideration): Explore the Figma Library
Analytics API for potential future insights into design system usage.
3.2. Figma Plugin Development
Objective: Create a user-friendly Figma plugin that facilitates seamless interaction
between designers in Figma and the Ferdinand design system.
Key Tasks:
Plugin UI: Design and develop the plugin's user interface within Figma.
Authentication: Integrate the plugin with Ferdinand's authentication system
to ensure secure access.
Two-Way Synchronization: Implement the core logic for two-way
synchronization of design tokens and styles (colors, typography, spacing,
components, interactive states) between the active Figma file and Ferdinand.
Design System Generator (Pull): Allow designers to pull existing design
tokens and styles from Ferdinand into their Figma file, applying them to
selected layers or creating new styles.
Push New Styles/Components: Enable designers to push new styles or
components created within Figma to Ferdinand's design system, updating the
backend and theme.json .
Conflict Notification: Implement a mechanism within the plugin to notify
users of synchronization conflicts and indicate that Ferdinand's version will
be the source of truth.

3.3. Conflict Resolution
Objective: Ensure data integrity and consistency during two-way synchronization.
Mechanism: In the event of a conflict (e.g., a token/style is updated in both Figma
and Ferdinand simultaneously), the system should:
Trigger a notification to the user (both in Ferdinand and potentially via the
Figma plugin).
Automatically revert to the version present in the Ferdinand application
(Ferdinand is the source of truth).
3.4. Synchronization Trigger
Initial Implementation: For the initial phase, implement a manual
synchronization trigger (e.g., a
"Sync Now" button in both Ferdinand and the Figma plugin). Consider future iterations
for real-time synchronization.
4. Deliverables
A functional Figma REST API integration within Ferdinand, enabling data exchange.
A fully developed Figma plugin with the specified synchronization and generation
functionalities.
Updated Ferdinand UI to reflect the integrated design system builder, replacing
placeholder content.
Comprehensive documentation for the Figma integration, including API usage,
authentication setup, and plugin usage instructions.
5. Success Metrics
Successful two-way synchronization of colors, typography, spacing, components,
and interactive states between Ferdinand and Figma.
Designers can effectively use the Figma plugin to pull and push design system
elements.
Conflict resolution mechanism functions as expected, with appropriate user
notifications.
Positive feedback from designers on the ease of use and efficiency of the
integration.
