PRD: Custom Body Type Styles Section
Problem Statement
Currently, the Type Scale Manager allows for custom styling of header elements (H1-H6) through an individual customization system with toggle chips. However, the body type styles (body, body-large, body-small, code, caption, quote) lack this same level of granular customization, limiting design flexibility for typography hierarchies.

Goals
Extend Customization Parity: Provide the same level of individual styling control for body type elements that currently exists for headers
Maintain Design Consistency: Follow the existing UI/UX patterns established by the header customization section
Preserve Type Hierarchy: Ensure custom body styles work harmoniously with the existing type scale system
Schema Compatibility: Extend the current data structure to support body type customizations
Success Criteria
Users can click toggle chips to activate custom styling for any of the 6 body type elements
Each activated body type shows an individual customization panel similar to headers
Custom styles override default body type styles while maintaining inheritance fallbacks
Changes are persisted to the database and reflected in real-time preview
CSS/SCSS export includes custom body type styles
Technical Requirements
1. Schema Updates
Extend IndividualHeaderStyle interface to IndividualTypeStyle (or create separate interface)
Add individualBodyStyles property to TypeScale interface with keys for:
body
body-large
body-small
code
caption
quote
2. UI Components
Add "Custom Body Styling" section below existing "Custom Header Styling"
Implement toggle chips for body type elements matching header chip design
Create individual customization panels for each body type with same controls as headers:
Font Family (dropdown from brand fonts)
Font Weight (dropdown)
Letter Spacing (number input)
Color (color picker)
Reset buttons for each property
3. State Management
Extend activeHeaderCustomizations pattern with activeBodyCustomizations state
Add functions similar to existing header customization:
toggleBodyCustomization(bodyLevel: string)
updateIndividualBodyStyle(bodyLevel: string, styleUpdates)
resetIndividualBodyStyle(bodyLevel: string, property)
4. Preview Integration
Update TypeScalePreview component to apply individual body styles
Modify getStyleForLevel function to check for body-specific overrides
Ensure proper fallback hierarchy: individual → body defaults → global defaults
5. Export Functionality
Update CSS/SCSS export generation to include custom body styles
Modify generateCodePreview function to output body-specific custom variables and classes
Implementation Priority
High Priority: Schema updates and database migrations
High Priority: UI toggle chips and basic state management
Medium Priority: Individual customization panels
Medium Priority: Preview integration and real-time updates
Low Priority: Export functionality updates
User Experience Flow
User navigates to Type Scale Manager
User scrolls to "Body Type Styles" section
User sees new "Custom Body Styling" subsection with 6 toggle chips
User clicks a chip (e.g., "BODY LARGE") to activate customization
Customization panel appears with font controls and reset options
Changes reflect immediately in preview pane
User can save changes and export updated CSS/SCSS
Dependencies
Existing header customization system as template
Current TypeScale and IndividualHeaderStyle interfaces
Brand font assets for dropdown population
Type scale preview and export systems
Risk Considerations
Data Migration: Existing type scales need migration path for new schema
Performance: Additional style calculations may impact preview rendering
Complexity: UI may become cluttered with too many customization options
Consistency: Need to ensure body customizations don't conflict with header styles
Acceptance Criteria
 Body type elements can be individually customized with same controls as headers
 Custom body styles persist across sessions
 Preview accurately reflects all custom body styles
 Export includes custom body type CSS/SCSS
 UI follows existing design patterns and remains intuitive
 No breaking changes to existing header customization functionality
