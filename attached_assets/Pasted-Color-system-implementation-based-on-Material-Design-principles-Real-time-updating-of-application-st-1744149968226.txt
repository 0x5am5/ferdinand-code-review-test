Color system implementation based on Material Design principles
Real-time updating of application styles when changes are made
Save/revert functionality
Extension of design builder to individual client instances

Color System Implementation
Follow Material Design color system approach with:
Brand Colors

Primary, Secondary, Tertiary colors as base brand colors
For each brand color, automatically generate:

Two lighter tints (80% lighter, 90% lighter)
Two darker shades (80% darker, 90% darker)
On-color variant (for text/icons on the base color)
Container variant (for backgrounds)
On-container variant (for text/icons on container)



Neutral Palette

Create 11 shades of gray from a single gray input
Range should go from very light to very dark

Interactive Colors

Error, Success, Warning system colors
These should have proper contrast with brand colors
Each interactive color should have light/dark variants and on-color variants

Technical Implementation Details
Variable System
Create a comprehensive CSS variable system with:

Raw/core variables (base colors)
Semantic variables (purpose-specific tokens mapped to core variables)

Example structure:
css/* Core Variables */
--brand-primary: #3366FF;
--brand-primary-tint-1: #668AFF; /* 80% lighter */
--brand-primary-tint-2: #99B1FF; /* 90% lighter */
--brand-primary-shade-1: #1A40CC; /* 80% darker */
--brand-primary-shade-2: #051A80; /* 90% darker */

/* Semantic Variables */
--color-button-bg: var(--brand-primary);
--color-button-text: white;
--color-card-border: var(--neutral-200);
State Management
Implement a state management solution to:

Store current theme settings
Provide methods to update settings
Enable save/revert functionality
Persist settings between sessions

Style Application
Create a mechanism to:

Apply theme changes in real-time
Re-compile or regenerate CSS when changes are made
Scope styles appropriately (global app styles vs client-specific themes)

UI Components
Update the design builder interface to:

Show color input controls with preview
Display generated palettes based on input colors
Provide real-time preview of changes
Include save/revert buttons
Allow theme variant selection (professional, tint, vibrant)

Specific Features to Implement
1. Color Editor Page

Create a dedicated color editor page in the design builder
Allow adding new brand colors
Show generated tints and shades for each color
Display on-color variants
Preview text/background combinations
Implement color picker with hex/rgb/hsl input

2. Theme Variants System

Define characteristics for each theme variant (professional, tint, vibrant)
Create preset mappings for each variant
Implement logic to transform base colors according to variant rules

3. Save/Load System

Implement save functionality that persists theme settings
Create a mechanism to revert unsaved changes
Add ability to export/import theme settings
Enable theme previewing before applying

4. Application-Wide Style Propagation

Ensure all UI components consume theme variables
Update component styles to reflect theme changes
Handle light/dark mode transitions
Apply border radius settings consistently

5. Client-Specific Theme Extension

Design a system to extend global theming to client instances
Create proper scoping for client-specific themes
Build UI for client theme editing within client settings
