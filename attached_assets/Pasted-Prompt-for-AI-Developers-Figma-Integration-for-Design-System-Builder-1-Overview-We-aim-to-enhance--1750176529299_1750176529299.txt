Prompt for AI Developers: Figma
Integration for Design System Builder
1. Overview
We aim to enhance our brand management platform, Ferdinand, by integrating a design
system builder that can synchronize with Figma. This feature will allow our users to
manage their design tokens and styles within Ferdinand and seamlessly sync them with
their Figma design files. The primary goal is to establish a two-way synchronization for
core design system elements, ensuring consistency between design and development.
2. Application Context: Ferdinand
Ferdinand is a comprehensive brand management platform built as a multi-tenant SaaS
application. It centralizes and manages brand assets, design systems, and guidelines for
various clients. It's a web application with the following tech stack:
Frontend: React 18 with TypeScript, built with Vite
Backend: Node.js with Express.js
Database: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
Authentication: Firebase Authentication with Google OAuth
UI Framework: Tailwind CSS + Radix UI primitives (shadcn/ui)
State Management: TanStack React Query for server state, React Context for
theme management
Routing: Wouter for client-side routing
Forms: React Hook Form with Zod validation
3. Current Design System State (Work-in-Progress)
Our current design system, "Green Bull Creative Design System," is modular and
scalable. It includes:
Color System:
Core structure: Base color, 2 lighter shades, 2 darker shades for each palette.
Brand Palette: brand.primary , brand.primaryLight ,
brand.primaryDark , brand.secondary , brand.accent .

◦ 
Neutral Palette (Gray Scale): 11 steps ( neutral.0 to neutral.1000 ) with
curved saturation-lightness logic.
Interactive Palette: interactive.success , interactive.error ,
interactive.warning , interactive.link (with light/dark variations).
Typography System:
Font Families: body (Rock Grotesque), heading (IDpresso Display).
Type Scale (Responsive): Defined by modular scale and base size, with raw
tokens ( --font-size-base , --font-size-sm , etc.) and semantic tokens
( --type-h1 , --type-body , etc.).
Line Height: Ratio-based ( --line-height-base , --line-heightheading ).
Letter Spacing: Tokenized ( --letter-spacing-xs , etc.).
Spacing & Layout:
Spacing unit: 4px.
Tokenized scale: --space-xs to --space-2xl .
Grid Breakpoints: mobile , tablet , desktop , wide .
Interactive States: hover , active , clicked , visited , inactive
(tokenized, e.g., --btn-bg-hover ).
Components (Initial List): Buttons, Form inputs, Cards, Alerts, Overlays + modals,
Tabs.
All tokens are currently synced with Ferdinand and can be programmatically output.
4. Figma Integration Requirements
4.1. Synchronization Direction & Scope
Two-way Synchronization: The system should support two-way synchronization
between Ferdinand and Figma. Changes made in either platform should be
reflected in the other.
Initial Scope: The initial focus for synchronization should include:
Color System
Typography System
Spacing & Layout
Components (definitions and properties)
Interactive States
Future Scope (Icons): While not in the first pass, the integration should be
designed to easily accommodate icon synchronization in the future.

4.2. Conflict Resolution
In the event of a two-way synchronization conflict (e.g., a token/style is updated in
both Figma and Ferdinand simultaneously), the system should:
Throw a notification to the user indicating a conflict.
Revert to the version present in the Ferdinand application (Ferdinand is the
source of truth in case of conflict).
4.3. User Experience for Connection
The connection process between Figma and Ferdinand should be as simple and
user-friendly as possible. Developers should explore options like:
Figma OAuth for secure authentication.
Allowing users to input Personal Access Tokens.
Manually inputting Figma file URLs for specific file synchronization.
4.4. Figma Plugin Functionality
A dedicated Figma plugin will be crucial for this integration. The plugin should enable
designers to:
Sync Design System: Facilitate the two-way synchronization of design tokens and
styles between Ferdinand and the active Figma file.
Design System Generator: Allow designers to pull existing design tokens and
styles from Ferdinand into their Figma file.
Push New Styles/Components: Enable designers to push new styles or
components created within Figma to Ferdinand's design system.
Validation (Future Consideration): The plugin could potentially include
functionality to validate that designs in Figma are using approved tokens from the
Ferdinand system (this can be a later enhancement).
4.5. Synchronization Trigger
The synchronization can be either real-time or manually triggered. Developers
should implement the easiest approach for the initial version, with consideration
for potential real-time updates in future iterations.

5. Technical Considerations & API Usage
Figma REST API: This API will be primarily used for programmatic access to Figma
files, allowing Ferdinand to:
Read and extract design data (colors, typography, spacing, component
properties) from Figma files.
Automate syncing of Figma libraries to and from the Ferdinand codebase.
Potentially access details of other Figma files from within the Ferdinand
application.
Figma Plugin API: This API will be used to build the interactive Figma plugin,
enabling:
Real-time changes to the contents of a Figma design or FigJam file.
Editing almost any aspect of a Figma design or FigJam file.
Interaction with the user within the Figma environment.
6. Deliverables
A functional design system builder feature within Ferdinand that integrates with
Figma.
A working Figma plugin that facilitates the described synchronization and
generation functionalities.
Clear documentation for both the Ferdinand integration and the Figma plugin,
including API usage and setup instructions.
7. Success Metrics
Successful two-way synchronization of colors, typography, spacing, components,
and interactive states between Ferdinand and Figma.
Positive user feedback on the ease of connecting Figma and using the plugin.
Reduced manual effort for designers and developers in maintaining design
consistency.
